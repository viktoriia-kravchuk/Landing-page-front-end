# Front-end recruitment task

Your task is to create fully responsive part of website. All files are included in Instruction files folder. For desktop please do as in preview/photoshop file "pixel perfect", but for mobile it is your imagination, do it as you think :)

## How to start
Download all repository files to your github profile by using fork functionality or by just download/upload files. Your repository should be public. If you do some more commits than only one "all changes" it will be a plus :)

All functionalities should be coded in pure JS (vanilla js) with ES6 standard.


## Installation

To run task use commands below:

```bash
  cd recruitment-front-end
  npm install
```


## Usage
To run app in local server use command:
```bash
npm run dev
```
It will open browser automatically and point to localhost:3000. Webpack has hot reload so all changes in code will cause reloading the page.

When you end creating code use command:
```bash
npm run build
```
To create distribution package.



## Main task
- change site title to your Name and Surname
- all images should be exported from photoshop (adobe has free 30 days trial)
- for desktop design - all positions should be as in project (preserving responsiveness)
- for mobile design - feel free to create it by your own, we want to see if you are creative too :)
- when you click on play button popup should appear with responsive youtube iframe inside (choose your favourite song wideo)


Remember to use ES6, BEM, clean code and other methodes to create pure and easy to read code.


## How we will test it?

We have our non technical friend who will check your task with instruction below.

- if it is on git enviroment and project has own gitub page we go to last point if not we go to next point.
- download task from git repository (if we have access to it)
- unzip files
- run dist/index.html in the browser
- if page is barerly not identical to design or responsive is not working (friend will resize browser window) the task will be marked as failed
